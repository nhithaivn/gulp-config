## 4. Tasks

-   `pnpm start`: Shorthand for `pnpm dev`
-   `pnpm dev`: Build Project + Watch + Node Server
-   `pnpm build`: Build Project (min)
-   `pnpm serve`: Run production local server

## 5. Pug global variables

-   `$translator`: object variable get value from `app/locales/#{lang}.json`
-   `$localeName`: variable get value equal name of current using locale json

## 6. JS Dynamic import path (chunks files)

At `src/views/_layouts/layout.pug`, there is a script with variable `staticJsAssetsPath`, update that variable to server js path, and it will load correctly chunks files

## 7. Single language mode

Just remove folder `src/locales`

## 8. Site favicon
